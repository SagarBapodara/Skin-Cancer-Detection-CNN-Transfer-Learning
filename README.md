# README

This file contains all the information about the developed skin cancer detection project. 

- Project Developed By: Divyash Kumbhani, Sagar Bapodara and Jay Kanani.

## Overview: 
This project aims to classify skin cancer types (Basal Cell Carcinoma, Melanoma, Nevus) using a deep learning model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of skin lesions. Users can upload an image, and the model will predict the type of skin cancer.

## Tech Used 

**Language:** Python (3.10)

**Front-End:** Streamlit
